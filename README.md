## This is the final project of CS5004(Object Oriented Design)

This is a basketball game simulation project that aims to establish the storage structure of player data and the control logic of the game. 
The project uses a chained table to store dynamic player data, a tree structure to store and manage each player's game statistics,
and the MVC design pattern to implement a basketball mini-game that contains actions such as steal, shoot, and block. 
The design of interfaces and abstract classes followed the SOLID design principles and used the Iterator pattern to iterate through 
the actions that occur in the game. By creating implementation classes, driver classes and test classes for each part, the project successfully 
implemented the simulation of the basketball game. Thanks to the reasonable data structure design, clear class structure division, 
the use of common design patterns and the adherence to the SOLID principles, the code of this project has a clear structure, is highly 
maintainable and easy to extend, and different functions and responsibilities are well decoupled and encapsulated in different modules.
